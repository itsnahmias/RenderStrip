RenderStrip script - Michael nahmias ¬© 2020

1. Lets you render the active Comp at the same moment by sending the comp to AME and start rendering it.
2. Lets you to send the active Comp to AME WITHOUT it starting to render
3. change the comp duration by typing the number of seconds and apply it with a button

# Few points üßê

I created it as a strip and there for the name ( original right? )

So it will be comfortable to place it while you are working.

The script is dock able so you can play with it, but I found that the best places is under the preview screen or under the project panel like so
